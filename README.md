## Overview

**Wrapper** is a unified Python library designed to interact with multiple Large Language Model (LLM) providers through a **single consistent interface**. Cuz every provider thought 'lets make our own fkin API format so devs can suffer'    

---

## Installation

```bash
# Install via pip
pip install wrapper
```

or if you dont trust PyPI (fair), clone this repo and slap it into your env:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anubhavgirdhar1/wrapper.git
cd wrapper
pip install -e .
```

---
## .env setup (don‚Äôt be that guy who pastes keys into code)

Make a .env file. Throw your keys in it. Done.

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-fuckingspam
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
GROQ_API_KEY=groq-faster-than-your-ex
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxxx
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxxx
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=claude-knows-too-much
```

you can ignore this too, wrapper will ask you for it, don't be a dih, none is free.

---

## ‚ö° Quick Start

```python
from wrapper import Wrapper

# Initialize provider
OpenAI_Client = Wrapper("openai")
Ollama_Client = Wrapper("ollama")

# Generate text
response = OpenAI_Client.generate(
    model="gpt-4",
    user="say 'dih' if you are alive",
)
print(response)

# Using Ollama with default system prompt
response2 = Ollama_Client.generate(
    model="gemma3n",
    user="say 'puh' if you are alive"
)
print(response2)
```
